# Security Policy

## Supported versions

| Version | Supported          |
|---------|--------------------|
| main    | ✅ actively tested |
| < next release | ⚠️ only critical fixes |

We plan to support the latest tagged release and the `main` branch. Older
releases might receive critical patches at the maintainers' discretion.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please email security reports to **security@jenkins-cli.dev** with:

- A description of the vulnerability and potential impact.
- Steps to reproduce or proof-of-concept code.
- Any known mitigations or workarounds.

We aim to acknowledge new reports within **3 business days** and provide a
status update within **7 business days**. Responsible disclosure is appreciated;
we will coordinate a release window before publishing details.

## Preferred languages

English is preferred for security reports. Let us know if translation support is
needed.

## Public disclosure

We will credit reporters in release notes if they wish. Public disclosure should
only happen after a fix has shipped or by mutual agreement.
