# jk - Jenkins CLI for developers

`jk` is a GitHub CLIâ€“style command line for Jenkins controllers. The CLI is written in Go and targets macOS, Linux, and Windows with a single static binary.

## Project status

Phase 0 + Phase 1 MVP scaffolding is now in place:

- Auth and context management backed by the OS keyring (`jk auth login`, `jk context ls/use/rm`).
- Shared configuration, logging, and Jenkins path utilities.
- HTTP client with CSRF crumb handling, capability detection, and version handshakes.
- Core developer workflows (`job ls/view`, `run start/ls/view`, `log follow`, `artifact ls/download`, `queue ls/cancel`, `test report`).
- Basic unit tests and `make` targets for build/test/tidy.

Refer to `docs/spec.md` for the full technical plan and `docs/api.md` for JSON contracts.

## Building from source

```bash
make build   # produces ./bin/jk
make test    # runs go test ./...
```

> Ensure Go 1.22 is available. The Makefile prepends the Homebrew Go 1.22 toolchain (`/opt/homebrew/opt/go@1.22/bin`) to `PATH` by default.

## Quick start (local development)

```bash
# Authenticate and create a context
jk auth login https://jenkins.company.example

# Inspect configuration
jk auth status
jk context ls

# Explore jobs and runs
jk job ls --folder team
jk run ls team/app/pipeline
jk run view team/app/pipeline 128
jk run start team/app/pipeline --follow

# Stream logs and fetch artifacts
jk log follow team/app/pipeline 128
jk artifact ls team/app/pipeline 128
jk artifact download team/app/pipeline 128 -p "**/*.xml" -o out/

# Queue and test insights
jk queue ls
jk test report team/app/pipeline 128
```

`examples/parity-smoke.sh` outlines the acceptance flow we will automate during Phase 1 to demonstrate `gh` parity.

## Repository structure

```
cmd/jk           # entry point
pkg/cmd          # Cobra command implementations
pkg/jenkins      # Jenkins client and helpers
pkg/config       # Config file model
pkg/secret       # Keyring integration
pkg/log          # Logging helpers
pkg/terminal     # Prompt utilities
plugin/          # Placeholder for Phase 3 companion plugin
```

## Testing

`go test ./...` exercises helper utilities today (job path encoding, duration formatting, exit-code mapping). Integration and contract tests against a live Jenkins matrix will arrive in later phases per the spec.

## Contributing

1. Fork and clone the repo.
2. Install Go 1.22.
3. Run `make build` and `make test` before submitting changes.
4. Keep the specification (`docs/spec.md`) and API contract (`docs/api.md`) up to date with behavioral changes.
